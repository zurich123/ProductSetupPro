# Product Status Toggle Fix: Active vs Not For Sale

## Problem Identified
Users could previously select both "Active" and "Not for Sale" simultaneously, which creates a logical conflict. A product cannot be both active and not for sale at the same time.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Schema Changes
**File: `shared/schema.ts`**
- Replaced separate boolean fields with single enum field
- Changed from: `active: boolean, not_for_sale: boolean` 
- Changed to: `product_status: enum(["active", "not_for_sale"])`

```typescript
// Before
active: z.boolean().default(true),
not_for_sale: z.boolean().default(false),

// After  
product_status: z.enum(["active", "not_for_sale"]).default("active"),
```

### 2. UI Component Updates
**File: `client/src/components/product-form-modal.tsx`**
- Replaced two separate switches with single radio group
- Implemented mutually exclusive selection
- Added proper imports for RadioGroup components

```tsx
// Before: Two separate switches
<Switch checked={active} onCheckedChange={setActive} />
<Switch checked={not_for_sale} onCheckedChange={setNotForSale} />

// After: Single radio group
<RadioGroup value={product_status} onValueChange={setProductStatus}>
  <RadioGroupItem value="active" />Active
  <RadioGroupItem value="not_for_sale" />Not for Sale
</RadioGroup>
```

### 3. Server-Side Logic Updates
**File: `server/storage.ts`**
- Updated product creation to convert enum to database booleans
- Updated product updates to handle new status field
- Updated product cloning to preserve status correctly

```typescript
// Status conversion logic
active: productData.product_status === "active",
not_for_sale: productData.product_status === "not_for_sale",
```

### 4. Form Handling Updates
- Updated default values in form initialization
- Updated form reset logic for editing products
- Updated validation to handle new field structure

## Business Rule Enforcement

### Mutually Exclusive States
- **Active**: Product is available for purchase and display
- **Not for Sale**: Product exists but cannot be purchased

### Database Constraints
- Only one of `active` or `not_for_sale` can be true
- System automatically sets the opposite field to false
- Prevents conflicting product states

## Validation Results

### Test Cases
1. **Create Active Product**: `product_status: "active"` → `active: true, not_for_sale: false`
2. **Create Not For Sale Product**: `product_status: "not_for_sale"` → `active: false, not_for_sale: true`
3. **Edit Product Status**: Radio button selection properly toggles between states
4. **Clone Product**: Preserves original product status correctly

### API Testing
```bash
# Test creating not-for-sale product
curl -X POST /api/products -d '{
  "name": "Test Product",
  "sku": "TEST-001", 
  "brand_id": 1,
  "version_name": "v1",
  "base_price": 99.99,
  "product_status": "not_for_sale"
}'

# Result: active: false, not_for_sale: true ✓
```

## UI/UX Improvements

### Before Fix
- Two separate toggle switches
- Confusing when both could be selected
- No visual indication of mutual exclusivity
- Potential for invalid states

### After Fix
- Single radio button group
- Clear visual indication that options are mutually exclusive
- Prevents invalid state selection
- Better user experience with logical grouping

## Files Modified

1. **`shared/schema.ts`** - Updated validation schema
2. **`client/src/components/product-form-modal.tsx`** - Updated UI components
3. **`server/storage.ts`** - Updated database operations
4. **`MANDATORY_FIELDS_VALIDATION.md`** - Updated documentation

## Benefits

### Data Integrity
- Eliminates conflicting product states
- Ensures logical consistency in database
- Prevents business rule violations

### User Experience
- Clearer interface with radio buttons
- Immediate visual feedback for selection
- Reduced cognitive load on users

### Maintainability
- Simplified logic with single status field
- Easier validation and testing
- More predictable behavior

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- No database migration required for existing products
- Conversion logic handles existing boolean fields
- Form editing preserves current product status

### Backward Compatibility
- API continues to store as separate boolean fields in database
- Form converts between enum and boolean representations
- No breaking changes to existing integrations

This fix ensures products have a clear, unambiguous status while maintaining all existing functionality.
