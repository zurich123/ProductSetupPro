## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive business rules implemented in the Healthcare Product Management System and provides detailed validation evidence. The system manages complex healthcare education products with multi-tier pricing, certification tracking, and professional development requirements.

**System Scope**: Healthcare education product management with support for:
- Multi-version products with shared SKUs
- Brand-ecosystem relationships
- Professional certification tracking
- Complex pricing and revenue recognition
- Multi-language content delivery
- Professional experience targeting

---

## Business Rules Documentation

### 1. SKU Sharing Across Product Versions

**Rule**: All versions of the same product must share the same SKU identifier.

**Business Rationale**: 
- Ensures inventory tracking consistency
- Prevents SKU conflicts between product variants
- Simplifies reporting and analytics across product versions

**Implementation**:
- SKU stored at the `offering` table level
- All `sku_version` records inherit the same SKU through foreign key relationship
- Database enforces one-to-many relationship: one offering → many versions

**Example**:
```
Product: "Advanced Cardiac Care Certification"
SKU: "ACC-CERT-2024"
├── Professional Level (8 CE credits, $299.99)
├── Premium Level (12 CE credits, $499.99)
└── Enterprise Level (16 CE credits, $699.99)
```

### 2. Brand-Ecosystem Automatic Derivation

**Rule**: Each brand belongs to exactly one ecosystem, and product ecosystem is automatically derived from the selected brand.

**Business Rationale**:
- Eliminates manual ecosystem selection errors
- Ensures brand consistency across product catalog
- Maintains clear market segmentation

**Implementation**:
- `brand_lookup.ecosystem_id` foreign key to `ecosystem.ecosystem_id`
- Application automatically sets product ecosystem based on brand selection
- User interface shows ecosystem as read-only confirmation

**Brand-Ecosystem Mappings**:
```
Acme Healthcare → Healthcare Ecosystem
MedTech Solutions → Healthcare Ecosystem
Wellness Corp → Healthcare Ecosystem
HealthFirst → Healthcare Ecosystem
```

### 3. Educational Content & Certification Tracking

**Rule**: Products must track educational qualifications, continuing education credits, and certification awards with professional development requirements.

**Business Rationale**:
- Supports healthcare professional licensing requirements
- Enables accurate CE credit reporting
- Maintains certification compliance records

**Implementation**:
- `sku_version_detail` tracks qualifying vs continuing education
- Credit hours stored as integer values
- Certification awards stored as text descriptions
- Access periods define validity timeframes

**Educational Classifications**:
- **Qualifying Education**: Counts toward initial professional certification
- **Continuing Education**: Maintains existing professional licenses
- **Credit Hours**: Numeric tracking for professional development requirements

### 4. Complex Pricing & Revenue Recognition

**Rule**: Products support multiple pricing models with configurable revenue recognition methods.

**Business Rationale**:
- Accommodates different customer payment preferences
- Ensures accurate financial reporting and compliance
- Supports various business models (subscription, one-time, promotional)

**Pricing Components**:
- **Base Price**: Standard one-time purchase price
- **MSRP**: Manufacturer's suggested retail price
- **COGS**: Cost of goods sold for margin calculation
- **Subscription Price**: Monthly recurring revenue option
- **Promotional Price**: Limited-time discount pricing
- **Professional Discounts**: Experience-based pricing tiers

**Revenue Recognition Methods**:
- Course Completion Recognition
- Progressive Module Recognition
- Subscription Recognition
- Assessment-Based Recognition

### 5. Feature Assignment & Value Differentiation

**Rule**: Product versions can have different feature sets to create clear value differentiation.

**Business Rationale**:
- Enables precise market segmentation
- Justifies pricing tier differences
- Allows flexible product positioning

**Feature Categories**:
- Mobile App Access
- Offline Content Download
- Live Virtual Sessions
- Certification Tracking
- Progress Analytics
- Simulation Lab Access
- VR Training Modules

**Example Feature Distribution**:
```
Professional Level: 4 features (Mobile, Download, Tracking, Analytics)
Premium Level: 6 features (+ Live Sessions, Simulation Lab)
Enterprise Level: 8 features (+ VR Training, Custom Content)
```

### 6. Multi-Language Content Support

**Rule**: Educational content structure must support multiple languages simultaneously.

**Business Rationale**:
- Enables global market expansion
- Supports diverse healthcare workforce
- Maintains content consistency across languages

**Implementation**:
- `sku_version_content` stores base content metadata
- `content_language` table links content to specific languages
- `language_lookup` provides language master data
- Many-to-many relationship supports multiple translations per content item

### 7. Professional Experience Targeting

**Rule**: Products can target specific healthcare professions and experience levels.

**Business Rationale**:
- Ensures content appropriateness for audience
- Supports regulatory compliance requirements
- Enables experience-based pricing strategies

**Targeting Criteria**:
- Years of professional experience
- Healthcare profession type
- Certification level requirements
- Institutional affiliations

### 8. Data Integrity & Referential Constraints

**Rule**: All relationships must maintain referential integrity with comprehensive constraint enforcement.

**Business Rationale**:
- Prevents orphaned database records
- Maintains data consistency across complex relationships
- Ensures reliable reporting and analytics

**Constraint Types**:
- Foreign key constraints for all relationships
- Check constraints for valid value ranges
- Not-null constraints for required fields
- Unique constraints for business identifiers
